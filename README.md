# Instructions to use this Python code
This Python file includes the 4 examples described in the book. They should be executed in a **single-step mode** to observe the outputs.
Examples 1, 2 and 3 are simple sequential codes. Example 4 illustrates digital signatures, and it uses a **'try' construct** to check a valid signature. This particular block of code should be executed as a block, with **breakpoints** or a **stepover command**. Besides, to have a complete experience, the entire example should be run twice, with and without modifying the signature after its generation.
